                        <li>Avoid over-baked or over-roasted products. Certain toxic products (acrylamide) could be generated during processing or cooking of bakery products, potato chips, coffee or roasted meat at high temperatures. Such products may taste bitter.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Avoid repeated usage of the same oil for frying purposes since this could generate some harmful chemicals in the oil. Cooking oils undergo rapid chemical changes due to the uncontrolled heat applied during frying. Furthermore, when you store oils, it is better to protect them from direct sunlight. Using stainless steel pans/ spoons for frying will ensure food safety. </li>

                        Coconut oil (saturated oil) would give comparatively less trouble during frying compared to unsaturated oils (e.g. gingelly oil, soya oil). Remember that coconut oil like vegetable oils do not contain cholesterol.
