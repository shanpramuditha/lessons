            <br>
            Food safety is the assurance that food will not harm us when it is prepared and/or consumed according to its intended use. Food should be wholesome and fit to eat. However, there are three major factors which could make food unsafe for human consumption.

                        <li>Chemical factors. E. g. Agrochemical residuals in poorly washed vegetables.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Physical factors. E.g. Sand or tiny stone particles in the rice plate</li>

                    A single factor or combination of these factors may cause mild or severe health problems of short-term or long-term duration. Fortunately, most of these factors can be controlled if you are vigilant and aware of the risk associated with these factors. For instance, if you eat spoiled food, you may get abdominal pain, vomiting, loose motion etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Further, if you don’t wash fruits or vegetables properly before eating, chemicals applied to them (if any) may not get washed away. Those chemicals may cause a severe threat to your life in the long-term such as cancer.
                    <br><br>
                    Accidental biting of tiny sand particles in your plate of rice may damage your teeth and may even lead to its permanent loss. These factors may be visible to your naked eye (e.g. sand particle) or invisible (e.g. chemicals or microbes). Thus you have to be vigilant to keep them out of your food. Handling food safely will spare yourself and also your family from illness.
