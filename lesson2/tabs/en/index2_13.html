	 <h1>Golden rules for a healthy and balanced lifestyle</h1>
	<div>Diet has a major role to play in both under-nutrition and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCD). A diet inadequate in quantity and quality, often due to poverty and ignorance, has been one of the immediate causes of under-nutrition. The same reason may not apply to DR-NCDs.Incorrect dietary practices and bad food habits are largely responsible for the emergence of DR-NCDs. Adherence to proper dietary guidelines and lifestyle modifications would help control the rising epidemic of DR-NCDs in the country.</div>
