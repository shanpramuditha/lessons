	 <h1>Diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCD)</h1>
	<div>While the under-nutrition problem is yet to be solved in many developing countries in the world, including Sri Lanka, many countries have also seen an increase in the recent past in diet-related non- communicable diseases. (DR-NCD)</div>
	<div>It is said that many developing countries today are faced with a situation called dual burden of malnutrition, characterized by both under-nutrition problem and DR-NCDs.</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
			<div>Characteristics of DR-NCD are a high prevalence of:</div>

	<div>      Overweight and obesity are other nutrition problems on the rise even among school children. This is prevalent mainly in the urban areas of Sri Lanka. Unhealthy dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles may have been influential factors for this change.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Healthy eating goes hand in hand with physical activity to enjoy a lifetime of health and well- being. Creating awareness among school children would be a timely and cost effective strategy to control this rising epidemic of diet-related non-communicable diseases.</div>
