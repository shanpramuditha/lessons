 <h1>What Happens to proteins during cooking?</h1>
  <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-12" >
       <ul>
           <li>Meat, fish and pulses (edible seeds of legumes) are good sources of protein which fulfill amino acid requirements in our body. During cooking, the nature of protein gets changed may be beneficial or harmful. The final outcome would depend on the art of cooking, ingredients added, level of heat, time ingredients were added and so on.</li>
            <img src="../img/5_6_1.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto">
           <li>Protein is made from combining various types of amino acids (building blocks of proteins). There are twenty different types of amino acids in proteins. Some of them cannot be produced in our body and therefore must be obtained through food (essential amino acids). Out of the twenty, nine are essential amino acids for the growing child. <br>
               There are:
               <ul>
                   <li> Lysine</li>
                   <li> Isoleucine</li>
                   <li>	 Lucien</li>
                   <li>	 Tryptophan</li>
                   <li>	 Methionine</li>
                   <li>	Phenylalanine</li>
                   <li>	Threonine</li>
                   <li>	Valine</li>
                   <li>	Histidine</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
       </ul><br>
       <p>However, only eight amino acids (except histidine) are considered essential for adult human.</p>

    <div class="row">

            <ul>
                <img src="../img/5_6_2.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto">
                <li>During cooking or processing of food, amino acids may be lost to a greater extent or may be changed into unavailable colour, but essential amino acids are lost in the process, causing deterioration in nutritional value. Lysine is one of the most affected essential amino acids. Loss of amino acid is proportional to the severity of heat applied.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>However, heating should not always be viewed in a negative sense. Destruction of trypsin inhibitor and other anti-nutritional factors and detoxification (e.g. cooking cassava in open pans) due to heat are some advantages. Heating also increases the palatability and digestibility of food.</p><br>

                        <h2>Note: </h2>
                        <p>Germination can improve the nutritional value and digestibility of pulses. During germination, the vitamins, minerals and enzymes are increased. Thus, sprouted beans are nutritionally better than raw beans.</p>
