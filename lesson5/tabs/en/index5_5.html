 <h1>What happens to carbohydrates during cooking?</h1>
  <div class="row">

       <ul>
           <li>Starchy food such as cereals (e.g. rich, wheat or corn), tubers (e.g. yams, potato) and roots (e.g. sweet potato, cassava) are the major carbohydrates in our diet. Cane sugar, glucose, honey, treacle (coconut or kithul) and jiggery are examples of simple carbohydrates or sugar that are usually consumed in smaller amounts.</li><br>
           <li>In raw form, starch is insoluble in water and indigestible. While cooking, the starch gets cooked and becomes sticky and soft. Proper cooking of starch food enhances its digestibility by facilitating the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose by enzyme (e.g. amylase) activity.</li><br>
           <li>Washing rice a number of times before cooking or draining excess water in the rice pot after cooking will cause water soluble vitamins, such as vitamin B complex (e.g. thiamin), to be lost. About 50% of thiamin in rice can be lost due to washing the rice and discarding the cooking water after.</li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>The nutrient loss is higher when washing raw rice (‘kekulu hal’) and discarding the water. In parboiled rice (‘thambapu hal’), a product of steaming raw rice, nutrient loss will not occur to the same extent of steaming raw rice, nutrient loss will not ocurr to the same extent because the parboiling process helps preserve water soluble nutrients inside the grain. Thus, parboiled rice can be more nutritious than raw rice.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>The removal of bran (niwudda’) outer layers during the polishing of rice leads to loss of vital nutrients in the bran such as vitamins, minerals and fiber. Thus, pearl white rice may give an attractive appearance but are nutritionally poor.</p>

            <img src="../img/5_5_3.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto">
            <p>Furthermore, the white wheat flour and white bread available in our market have undergone a considerable loss of major nutrients (protein, B-vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc) and fiber because of the lower extraction rate (72%) used in wheat milling. Thus rice is nutritionally superior to wheat flour or wheat flour based products.</p>
