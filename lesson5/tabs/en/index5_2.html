        <br>
        <li>    Post-harvest loss is another type of food loss which occurs when food items are contaminated by insects and rats or when perishable food is spoiled by microbial growth (this can occur in the field or in storage). Such post-harvest food losses are considerable and vary depending on the commodity.</li>
