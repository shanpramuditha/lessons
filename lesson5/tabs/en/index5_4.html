                   <li>To inhibit the action of natural enzymes which otherwise make food undesirable to eat</li><br>
                   <li>To make food safe to eat by removing toxins and other harmful substances (e.g. anti-nutritional factors)</li><br>
                   <li>To enhance nutritional value or digestion by increasing accessibility to digestive enzymes (e.g. cooked rice or meat)</li>
                   <li>To make food palatable and look better.</li><br>
                   <li>To prepare a variety of food products and convenient food items to enhance the choice of the consumer</li><br>
                   <li>To make certain beneficial factors available to our body. E.g. lycopene pigment in tomato is easily absorbed when it is cooked form (e.g. tomato paste, tomato sauce  or tomato curry) than it is in raw form (fresh tomato salad).</li>

       <p>It should be kept in mind that many changes occur in proteins, fats and carbohydrates due to heat. Heat may diminish nutritive value or even form toxic substances.</p>
       <p>Food can have a nutritional impact only if it is digested or available in a readily absorbable form. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the effects of cooking on digestibility. There is no general rule, and there are many examples in which it does not.</p>
