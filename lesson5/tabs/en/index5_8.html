               <p>Most heat sensitive vitamins are ascorbic acid, thiamin and folate. Loss of riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, vitamin A and vitamin E may also occur to some extent during processing.</p>
                <h2>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Highly soluble in water and sensitive to heat, oxygen, alkaline medium and sun light. Since vitamin C is lost when heated, add lime juice to curries only once it has cooled down. One of the best ways to get a satisfactory amount of vitamin C is through sambols like gotukola or fresh vegetable salad, which are not generally heated before consumption.</li><br>
                    <li>Destruction of ascorbic acid continues when the food is kept on a hot plate after cooking. Dehydration destroys most of vitamin C.</li><br>
                    <li>Eating a variety of food that contains vitamin C is the best way to get an adequate amount each day. Healthy individuals who eat a balanced diet rarely need supplements.</li><br>
                    <li>Best source of vitamin C is from fresh fruit, which do not have preservatives like sulfur Dioxide.</li><br>
