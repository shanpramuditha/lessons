    <h2>Objective</h2>
       To increase awareness of the loss of nutrients in food during cooking and processing and to introduce potential methods to minimize this.

    <h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
    <p>At the end of the food loss from students will be able to: </p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Differentiate food loss from food wastage</li>
        <br>
        <li>Describe how food and nutrient loss occurs during processing and cooking</li>
        <br>
         <li>Take precautions to minimize nutrient loss during cooking/ processing</li>
        <br>
         <li>Explain the value of fermentation as a method to enhance the nutritional value of food</li>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>We are now aware of the importance of nutrients, nutrient-rich food sources, undesirable material found in food and good hygienic practices. Despite your age, occupation, gender and food preferences, you should get an adequate amount of energy and balanced nutrients every day.</p>
		<p>However, due to lack of knowledge or carelessness, food and nutrient losses may occur. In certain cases, you can enrich the food by transforming its original nature. For instance, curd or yogurt like processed dairy products are rich in certain nutrients (e.g. B vitamins) and help reduce some health problems like lactose intolerance.</p>
		<p>This module will mainly focus on ways and means of safeguarding/ improving the nutritional value of food during processing and cooking.</p>
