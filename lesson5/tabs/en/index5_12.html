		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Food loss occurs in many ways. Losses due to negligence or wastage, post harvest losses due to insects, rodents and microorganisms etc. and the possibility of invisible losses of food and nutrients due to processing or cooking.</li><br>
			<li>Food processing helps in blending food ingredients in various ways to obtain delicate flavor, texture and colour, which appeal to the senses.</li><br>
			<li>During cooking of starchy food, starch gets cooked and becomes sticky and soft. Proper cooking of starchy food facilitates fast digestibility due to easy breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose by enzyme (e.g. amylase) activity.</li><br>
			<li>During cooking of protein food, the nature of protein changes. This process is called protein denaturation. These changes may be beneficial or harmful.</li><br>
			<li>Heating should not always be viewed in a negative sense. Destruction of trypsin inhibitor, other anti-nutritional factors and detoxification (e.g. cooking manioc in open pans) due to heat are advantages. It increases palatability and digestibility too.</li><br>
			<li>Microorganism are capable of converting certain components in food into a more palatable form, enhancing flavor, improving texture and nutritive value and preserving food.</li><br>
			<li>Keep iodated salt in a covered, dark container, away from heat and direct sunlight. </li><br>
			<li>Steamed parboiled rice is more nutritious than raw rice since this process helps to preserve most water soluble vitamins. Parboiled rice has another advantage for adults and diabetic patients in particular, as it does not rapidly increase blood glucose after consumption.</li><br>
			<li>Milk is a very good source of riboflavin and therefore for preservation; milk and their products should not be exposed to direct sunlight.</li><br>
