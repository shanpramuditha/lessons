           <div>When you visit a “polo” in the evening you may find vegetables and fruits cheap, but remember with the loss of freshness they are low in nutrients too. Heat and light sensitive nutrients such as vitamin C and folic acid may have been significantly destroyed! Loss of food and nutrients can be minimized by careful planning and management.</div>

    <h1>Food processing and cooking</h1>

       <p>
           Food processing involves a set of methods and techniques used to transform raw ingredients into food. Food processing methods vary from simple methods such as drying and fermentation (e.g. curd/yoghurt preparation), to complex processes such as the manufacture of processed cheese, spray drying, canning, bottling UHT etc.
           Food processing helps to combine food ingredients in various ways to produce delicate flavors, textures and colours which appeal to the senses.

       <p>The process of subjecting food to the action of heat is called cooking. The basic operations involved during household cooking and factory processing are similar (e.g. cutting, washing, heating), but the scale of operations is different.</p>
