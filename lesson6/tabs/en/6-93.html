                    Growth charts or child health and development records are essentially  weight-for-age and length-for-age  charts. growth charts are a standard part of any checkup and they show health care providers how kids are growing compared with other kids of the same age and gender. they also allow doctors and nurses to see the pattern of kids' height and weight gain over time and whether they're developing proportionately.
                    <br><br>
                    Let's say a child was growing along the same pattern until he was 2 years old and then suddenly started growing at a much slower rate than other kids. that might indicate a nutrition or health problem.
                    <br><br>
                    Genetics, gender, nutrition, physical activity, health problems, environment and hormones all influence a child's height and weight.
