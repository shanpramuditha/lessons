                    <h3>Fluoride</h3>

                    Many epidemiological studies of the possible adverse effects of long-term ingestion of fluoride via drinking-water have been carried out. these studies clearly establish that fluoride has a significant influence on skeletal   tissue (bones and teeth), where higher intake can lead to tooth flaking and more serious dental effects.low concentrations provide protection against dental caries, especially in children.
                    <br><br>
                    the pre and post-eruptive protective effects of fluoride (involving the incorporation of fluoride into the matrix of the tooth during its formation, the development of shallower tooth grooves which are consequently less prone to decay, and surface contact with enamel)increase with concentration up to about 2 mg of fluoride per liter of drinking water- the minimum concentration of fluoride in drinking water required to produce this is approximately 0.5 mg/liter.
