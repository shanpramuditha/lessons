                    There are an increasing number of elderly people with a wide range of body weight, chronic diseases, disabilities, and food preferences.
                    <br><br>
                    The elderly are the largest group of nutritionally vulnerable people, with those in residential care establishments at the greatest nutritional risk.

                    There is a reduction in energy requirements with increasing age, but an increased requirement for a number of nutrients such as protein, riboflavin, vitamin B15, calcium, vitamin D and, for some vitamin B12. Therefore, it is difficult for older people on relatively low-energy diets to meet their nutrient requirements solely from food. vitamin supplements and/ or fortified food may be required to meet these nutrient requirements.
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure optimal nutritional status, we must assess nutritional requirements on an individual level and provide practical advice regarding appropriate food choices which take into account physical and psychological conditions, body weight, level of physical activity, use of medication, food preferences, income, ethnic group, social support, access to retail food outlets, cooking facilities  and access to community support schemes.
