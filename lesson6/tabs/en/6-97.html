                    Nutrition in the womb is the process that delivers to the foetus what it needs to grow and develop into a healthy baby. a foetus receives its nutrition from two sources. the first source of nutrients is from the mother's diet during pregnancy and the other source is from the mother's own body.
                    <br><br>
                    the placenta, which is a part of the baby that attaches it to te womb, captures , nutrients from the mother's blood and transports it to the baby. the growth of the placenta and the food it supplies are the key to health for a lifetime.

                    low birth weight or birth weight less that 2500g is a major public health problem in many developing countries. about 17% of babies born in Sri Lanka are of LBW as compared to 4% in some developed countries.
                    <br><br>
                    Incidence of low birth weight is the highest among low-income groups. Maternal malnutrition and anemia appear to be significant risk factors in its occurrence.
