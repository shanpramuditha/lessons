                    Dietary inadequacy is more common among adolescent girls that in any other segment of the population.
                    <br><br>
                    The significance of this observation is increased by the fact that adolescence is a time when inadequate nutrition can lead to health problems that persist throughout life.

                    iron is needed in increased amounts, especially in the later stages of pregnancy. this mineral is essential to the formation of healthy red blood cells. it is difficult for a woman to consume enough of it from food  and a lack of it can often make her feel anaemic and exhausted. anaemia can make the mother less able to fight off infections and unable to handle hemorrhaging during the birth.
                    <br><br>
                    pregnancy  doubles a woman's need for folate (folic acid or folacin) and Vitamin B 12, Folic acid has been proven to be a important factor in preventing neural tube defects and is essential in formation of red blood cells.
                    <br><br>
                    folic acid can be found in a variety of food, including kidney beans, green leafy vegetables, peas and liver, women in their childbearing years should consume plenty of these food.
