                    There is a reduction in appetite with increasing age; therefore one of the key challenges is keeping older people interested in food through the development of meals and snacks that are both nutritious and appetizing.
                    <br><br>
                    Animal sources of protein are generally well accepted by older people and if tender cuts of meat are chosen and cooked correctly, even small amounts can assist the elderly to maintain adequate intakes of protein, vitamin B12 and iron.

                    <h3>Iodine</h3>
                    Excess dietary iodine is on the risk. these rises are attributed to iodine in iodized salt found in many food- especially prepackaged and fast food; iodine in food supplements; iodine added as a disinfectant to drinking  water, iodine supplements given to livestock ; idodine compounds used as dairy sanitizers; iodine used as a dough conditioner in bakeries, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    amounts over 500% of the RDA are considered  to be dangerous. excess levels of urinary iodine have been reported in some provinces in Sri Lanka (goiter surver,2005)
