                    height and weight measurements are used to construct three nutritional indicators ; height -for-age, weight-for-height and weight-for-age. These indicators are commonly used in nutrition surveys for assessing the nutritional status of pre-school age (0-5) children.

                <h3>Height-for age</h3>
                reflects achieved linear growth, where its deficits indicate long term cumulative inadequacies of health or nutrition,. low height- for-age (shortness or stunting)reflects a process of failure to reach linear growth  potential as a result of long standing (chronic) suboptimal health or nutritional conditions.

                    <h3>weight-for-height</h3>
                    reflects body weight relative to height. its use carries the advantage of requiring no knowledge of age in construction the indicator. low weight-for-height (thinness or wasting) implies a recent and severe process that has lead to significant weight loss, usually as a result of acute starvation and .or severe disease. on the other hand, high weight-for-height could be used to describe overweight in young children.

                    <h3>weight-for-age</h3>
                    reflects body mass relative to age.it is influenced by both the height (height-fr-age)and the weight (weight-for-height)of the child. however, in the absence of significant wasting in a community, similare information is provided by weight-fro age and height-for-age, in that both feflect long-term heallth and nutritional experience of the individucal or population. short-term change, especially reducation in weight-for -age, reveals change in weight-for height.
