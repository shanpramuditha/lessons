                    Growth during infancy and childhood depends on birth weight, adequacy of infant feeding and absence of infection.
                    <br><br>
                    Available data clearly indicates that exclusively breast-fed infants thrive normally during the first six month of life and have fewer illnesses (diarrhea, respiratory tract infection and fever) than those receiving supplements in addition to breast ild. steps should be taken for the protection and promotion of the practice of breast-feeding.
                    <br><br>
                    Introduction of mild substitutes too early and introduction of complimentary food too late are associated with increased risk of under nutrition and infection among infants.

                    Women planning a pregnancy should follow a balanced nutrient-rich diet. care should be taken to monitor the nutritional status of vulnerable groups (including adolescent girls) to ensure a healthy pregnancy outcome.
