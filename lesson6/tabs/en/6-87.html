            <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <br>
            To impart knowledge on the use of anthropometric measurements (comparative measurements of the body) in assessing nutritional status and to increase awareness of special nutritional needs in vulnerable groups.
            <br><br>
            <h2>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h2>
            <br>
            At the end of the module students will be able to:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Use simple instruments/ methods like growth chart, birth weight, height and weight and BMI to assess nutritional status</li>
                <li>Spell out the special dietary needs of very young children, pregnant and lactating mothers and elderly</li>
                <li>Describe nutrition-related issues specific to certain provinces such as fluorides in water, excess iodine etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <br>
        Anthropometry is concerned with the measurement of the physical dimensions (height, weight, circumference, skin-fold thickness etc.)  of the human body. This is performed at different age levels and offers the opportunity to assess the nutritional status and gross composition of the body.
        Environmental influences, especially nutrition, are of greater importance than genetic background or other biological factors. The physical dimensions of the body are highly influenced by nutrition, particularly in the rapidly growing period of early childhood.
