                <li>Cereals and starchy root crops (carbohydrate group) that we eat as staple food and major sources of energy are included at the bottom of the pyramid. About 6-11 servings of carbohydrates are recommended for a day. This may include rice, bread, string hoppers, hoppers, rotti, corn, etc.

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The next level of the pyramid is divided into two, and contains fruit and vegetables. Generally 3-4 servings of vegetables and 2-3 servings of fruit a day are recommended. After the carbohydrates, the next larger quantity in our diet should be vegetables and fruit.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The third layer in the pyramid is divided into two and has the meat group (meat, fish, eggs, pulses) and milk group ( milk cheese, curd), which both provide proteins. 2-3 and 1-2 servings a day respectively are recommended.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The topmost layer of the food pyramid is food that we should consume sparingly and includes fats like butter, margarine and cooking oil, salt and sweets. This holds especially true for adults like your parents, who may eat too much of fat, sugar and salty food that can be bad for their health in the long term.
